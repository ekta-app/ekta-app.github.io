## Meet the Team!

# [**Arjun Aggarwal**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arjun-aggarwal) Co-Founder, CEO (Pronouns: He/him/his)
I was first exposed to the desi competitive circuits when I started as a freshman at the University of Texas at Dallas. There was only one team on campus at the time, and no competitions. I was in choir and had a knack for music, so with the help of some friends, started a south asian a cappella group called Dhunki, helped start a bollywood fusion dance team called Sharara, and an A Cappella competition called Awaazein the following year. After graduating from UT Dallas, I partnered up with a few alum of the south asian circuit and created the Association of South-Asian A Cappella (ASA), and started the first chamionship competition of the circuit, All-American Awaaz (A3). I also served as the Digital Media Chair on the Bollywood American board. Now, I continue to serve as a senior advisor on the steering committee at ASA. For my day job (and sometimes night!), I am a physician and currently doing a cardiology fellowship at Wake Forest Baptist Health along with graduate school in translational research at Wake Forest University. I am passionate about the integration of artificial intellgience in cardiac medical device research and I enjoy spending my free time traveling and exploring the outdoors, spending time with friends and family, and learning new things!
