### [**Arjun Aggarwal**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arjun-aggarwal) | Co-Founder, CEO
*(Pronouns: He/him/his)*

I was first exposed to the desi competitive circuits when I started as a freshman at the University of Texas at Dallas. There was only one team on campus at the time, and no competitions. I was in choir and had a knack for music, so with the help of some friends, started a South Asian A Cappella group called Dhunki and an A Cappella competition called Awaazein the following year. During my team at UT Dallas, I also helped start a Bollywood Fusion dance team called Sharara and helped out with a few other dance teams with various projects. After graduating from UT Dallas, I partnered up with a few alum of the South Asian A Cappella circuit and created the Association of South-Asian A Cappella (ASA) and started the first chamionship competition of the circuit: All-American Awaaz (A3), of which I was the director for two years. I also served as the Digital Media Chair for Bollywood America 2017, and as an advisor for Bollywood America 2019. I was the Director of ASA for 4 years (2016-2020), and now, I continue to serve as a senior advisor on the steering committee at ASA. For my day job (and sometimes night!), I am a physician and currently doing a cardiology fellowship at Wake Forest Baptist Health along with graduate school in Translational and Health System Science at Wake Forest University. I am passionate about the integration of artificial intellgience in cardiac medical device research and I enjoy spending my free time traveling and exploring the outdoors, spending time with friends and family, and learning new things!
