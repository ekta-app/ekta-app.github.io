## How it all started

The idea for Ekta started when we were collecting information from teams for registration for A3 2017. We were asking them for information that they had already sent to bid competitions throughout the season, without any significant changes. Why not have a unified system - a common app. But instead of staying within one circuit, we wanted to take it a step further and make a common that would be the standard for all the circuits. The vision was to create a platform in which all members of all the teams across all the circuits can have a single login that they use to update their information and memberships. This way, an individual who is on more than one team or part of a team as well as a competition board, will use one single login for everything.
