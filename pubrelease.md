# Publishing and Releasing

## Publishing

Publishing simply makes a team/competition visible on the rest of the platform. A team/competition can still update their profile after publishing.

## Releasing

Releasing indicates that a competition is ready to accept applications. This is a one-way operation and can only be undone by the circuit managers. Once a competition is released, most of the competition profile is locked from editing, except for the **application timeline**.
