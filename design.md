# Ekta Design

## Users

- Ekta is designed with a user-first approach. Every **user** has their own individual login.
- Users can reset their password at [https://ekta.app/forgot](https://ekta.app/forgot).

## Organizations

- An organization is a **team** or **competition**.
- Most organizations will imported by **championships**.

## Membership

- Users are associated with **organizations** through **yearly** membership.
- Users can either be members or officers.
- Officers can add members to their organizations from the "Members" tab on the organization page.
- A user can be a member of multiple organizations per year.

### Join codes

- An organization's join code is a shortcut for officers to join a membership without needing someone else to add them.
- A user can use the join code when they want to establish a new membership with an existing organization.
- **IMPORTANT** Officers must ensure the join code stays secure because it may allow unwanted users to join the organization if it gets in the wrong hands.
  - Officers have the ability to refresh the join code if they so desire from the "Members" page.
